===============

Bookmarker is an ultimate solution for [Sketch App](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) to bookmark layers and navigate through the toggled bookmarks using predefined shortcuts or special overview mode.

This plugin is a real time saver when you work with huge documents and want to quickly navigate to any known part of it!
